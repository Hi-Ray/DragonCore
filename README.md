## Prerequisites
- [Go 1.14+](https://golang.org/) (optional)
- [Node 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/) (optional)
  - [Yarn 1.X](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Docker and Docker-Compose are used for running all the applications.
Node and Go are optional, as the only use is to install other dependencies
using a CLI. If you do want to install a dependency for node, do make sure 
to use Yarn.

## Setup
### Development
We also use a proxy in development mode, so you'll need to set some /etc/hosts values
in order to be able to have access to all the projects. Copy and paste the following values:
```
127.0.0.1  developer.communitydragon.localhost
127.0.0.1    traefik.communitydragon.localhost
127.0.0.1       auth.communitydragon.localhost
127.0.0.1        www.communitydragon.localhost
127.0.0.1        api.communitydragon.localhost
127.0.0.1            communitydragon.localhost
```
Everything is set up in docker. All you need to do is start up the containers using docker-compose.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Or run it as a daemon
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

&nbsp;

### Production
**(not set up yet)**

We use docker-images for the production build. Just use the following command (keep 
in mind, a proxy is set up within docker. You'll need to change out the domains if 
you want to run production yourself)
```bash
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.build.yml
```
You can now spin up the production images with the production docker-compose configuration file.
```bash
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.prod.yml -d
```
